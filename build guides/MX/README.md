**Drive Sizes**
1. 2.5 mm
2. 2 mm
3. 1.5 mm
## Disassembly
1. Place the assembled case face down on a soft, debris-free surface
2. Remove 8x case screws using a 2.5 mm driver, set aside at a safe place
3. Holding the case together with your hands, carefully flip the case to an upward facing orientation
4. Carefully lift off the top case, unplugging the JST wire if connected
5. Set bottom case aside
6. Remove 7x plate screws, if used, using a 2 mm driver and set aside at a safe  place
7. Carefully remove the plate and set aside
8. Disassembly finished!
## Case Assembly
1. Set the bottom case on a flat surface
	- ensure weight is flush with the bottom case, dampening could be affected if not
2. Remove daughterboard screws using a 1.5 mm driver
3. Carefully place the daughterboard into cutout
4. Screw the daughterboard into the case 
5. Attach JST wire to daughterboard, follow either O-Ring Assembly or Top-Mount Assembly instructions depending on desired build
### O-Ring Assembly
6. Place the bottom case, weight-side down, on a flat surface
7. Wrap plate-pcb assembly with the O-ring
8. Attach JST wire to PCB
9. Place assembly on top of the bottom case
11. Carefully slot top case onto the assembly, aligning with the bottom case
12. Hold the case together, flip the case, and place its sides along two raised edges. 
	- I used the two foam blocks included in the carrying case to keep the case elevated
13. Tighten the 8x case screws
14. Assembly finished! 
### Top-Mount Assembly
6. Lay the top case, flower side down, on a flat surface
7. Carefully slot plate-pcb assembly into the top case
8. Tighten 7x plate screws, using a 2 mm driver, anchoring the plate-pcb assembly to the top case
9. Attach JST wire to PCB 
11. Carefully slot top case onto the assembly, aligning with the bottom case
12. Hold the case together, flip the case, and place its sides along two raised edges. 
	- I used the two foam blocks included in the carrying case to keep the case elevated
13. Tighten the 8x case screws
14. Assembly finished!
## Flashing
1. Attach JST wire between PCB and daughterboard
2. Connect daughterboard to PC
3. Locate the push-button on the bottom side of the PCB
4. Open [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox)
5. Select appropriate firmware
6. Enable Auto-Flash
7. Depress the push-button
8. Allow the flashing process to finish
9. Test keys
