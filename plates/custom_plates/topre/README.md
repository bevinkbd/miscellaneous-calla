files are provided as is. these files are made by request and have not been prototyped. use at your own risk.

PLEASE NOTE: these are DXF files only. if you send these for production they will not be tapped (and thus you won't be able to screw into them). you would need to add M2 x 0.4 threads to every 1.6 mm diameter hole by either tapping it yourself (I don't recommend) calling it out in a drawing and having it done at a shop.
